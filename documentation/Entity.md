I need to understand write about MongoDB and Mongoose schemas in detail.
 
I need to understand why i'm using dotenv, morgan, and cors in the app setup.

I need to understand express setup.

# Entity Class Information

Since Carry-Me uses MongoDB as a DB and Mongoose as a framework, the Carry-Me relies on Schemas to create the structure of the classes.

Interesting Schema Types:

- Unique: ensure that a unique index is created for this path. If the index already exists on the DB then it will not be replaced.
